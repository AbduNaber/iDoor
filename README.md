# IDOOR ARDUINO SMART DOOR PROJECT

This project uses RFID modüle which can read the data in the cards, and with using this data it
can decide whether the person is us or not. Also it can understand when the door open with using
ultrasonic sensor and can communicate with us via ethernet by using ESP82266 wifi modüle. We can
command the system in order to open or close the door from ethernet. System uses servo motor for
opening and closing the door.




# iDoor

An Arduino project that allows you to open a door using an RFID card is a great way to add a level of convenience and security to your home or office. The project would involve using an Arduino board, an RFID reader, and a servo motor to control the door lock. The Arduino would be programmed to listen for a specific RFID card to be scanned. When the correct RFID card is scanned, the servo motor would rotate to unlock the door. The website could be accessed from any device connected to the internet, allowing you to check the door. Additionally, it has a log system to keep track of the time and date of when the door was opened, who opened it and when it was opened. This project is a perfect example of how Arduino can be used to create smart and secure systems that improve daily life.
